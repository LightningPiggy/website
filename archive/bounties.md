We don't currently have any open bounties, but could really do with some help with product design, character design, 3D model making, Python, C and C++ coding, and structured bitcoin education for 4-16 year olds.

If you have any of these skills and would like to contribute to the project please check out the [LightningPiggy GitHub page](https://github.com/LightningPiggy) and join our [telegram group](https://t.me/+jUcn6TWrli1iMzI8).

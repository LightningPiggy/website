Design, build and decorate a piggy using any materials you wish. Please include your name (or nickname) and age if you would like to share that information.

## **Tips**

- It doesn’t have to be a pig.
- You can attach either a dummy computer screen or a dummy computer to your design for extra realism.
- If you have a great idea, but don’t have the materials and/or equipment, you can design your piggy on paper. Include drawings and any extra information you think that’s needed to make it.

Trotting in hot we’re thrilled to announce that version 4 of the Lightning Piggy code has just been released. And there’s a beast of a change log…

## What’s new...

### User experience improvements

- Unified code supporting both 2.13 and 2.66 inch ePaper displays with auto detection at boot.
- Significantly faster display updates thanks to migrating libraries from GxEPD to GxEPD2.
- Enhanced boot logo to emphasise the lightning bolt in "LightningPiggy”.

### User interface improvements

- Where additional screen space allows more payment amounts and their associated messages will be displayed.
- Introduction of non-ascii characters such as öüäß thanks to the integration of U8g2_for_Adafruit_GFX library to support UTF-8 fonts.
- Addition of German (de_DE) and Swiss German (de_CH) boot slogans. Thanks @GABRl3L !
- Addition of Danish (da) boot slogans. Thanks @Jake21m !
- Currency symbols now placed before the fiat amount where appropriate.
- Addition of proper fiat currency symbols (€,£,$,¥) where appropriate.

### Fixes

- Update notifications (they were broken in v3.x).

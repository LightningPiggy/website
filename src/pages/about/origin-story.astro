        <p>Born in an industrial pig farm, he and his family are kept in cramped suffering conditions.</p>

        <p>While on the way to slaughter there's a massive thunderstorm, and the lorry he's travelling in gets struck by lightning. He runs free and the farmer chases him into a forest.</p>

        <p>While on the run he dives down a rabbit hole. He hears voices outside and keeps on running, deep down the hole. It turns out the hole is very deep indeed.</p>

        <div class="text-center text-3xl py-4">&#x2022; &#x2022; &#x2022;</div>

        <p>He sees a floating figure ahead, it's a space cat called <strong>Hodlnaut</strong>. They meet and Hodlnaut gives him a headlight in the shape of a lightning bolt, so that he can find the way.</p>

        <p>He then meets a golden monkey called <strong>Schifty</strong> who tries to trade his light for a dumb lump of rock, but the piggy politely declines and the monkey goes on his way, swinging from overhanging tree roots.</p>

        <p>Lightning Piggy, lost, hungry and scared, meets a rat called <strong>Craig</strong>, who sends him the wrong way towards a killer ants nest.</p>

        <p>Fortunately a <strong>white rabbit</strong>&mdash;who knows the hole well&mdash;jumps to the rescue and gives the piggy a map with a route to the secret &ldquo;Chamber of Answers&rdquo;.</p>

        <div class="text-center text-3xl py-4">&#x2022; &#x2022; &#x2022;</div>

        <p>Following the map he finds the Chamber of Answers, deep down the rabbit hole, where two cypherpunks, <strong>Satoshi</strong> (an owl) and <strong>Hal</strong> (a black leopard), are busy writing code. They give Lightning Piggy a brightly coloured songbird called <strong>Torogoz</strong>, to lead him out to a new world, where everyone is free to live their lives and save for their family's futures.</p>
